# Script-
Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a simple Tetris game! Here's an outline of how to build a console-based Tetris game in Python:

1. First, you'll need to import some libraries:
```
import random
import time
```

2. Initialize the game board and create the game pieces:
```
board = [[0 for x in range(10)] for y in range(20)]

pieces = [
    [[1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]],
    [[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]],
    [[0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]],
    [[1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]],
    [[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1]],
    [[1, 1], [1, 1]],
    [[1, 1, 1, 1]],
]
```

3. Define a function to check if a piece can be placed on the board at a given position:
```
def can_place(piece, x, y):
    for row in range(len(piece)):
        for col in range(len(piece[0])):
            if piece[row][col] == 1:
                if x + col >= len(board[0]) or \
                    y + row >= len(board) or \
                    board[y+row][x+col] > 0:
                    return False
    return True
```

4. Define a function to place a piece on the board:
```
def place(piece, x, y, piece_num):
    for row in range(len(piece)):
        for col in range(len(piece[0])):
            if piece[row][col] == 1:
                board[y+row][x+col] = piece_num
```

5. Define a function to check for complete rows and remove them:
```
def remove_complete_rows():
    num_rows_removed = 0
    for row in range(len(board)):
        if all(board[row]):
            board.pop(row)
            board.insert(0, [0 for x in range(10)])
            num_rows_removed += 1
    return num_rows_removed
```

6. Define a function to draw the game board:
```
def draw_board():
    for row in board:
        print(' '.join(map(str,row)))
```

7. Define the main game loop:
```
pieces_placed = 0
while True:
    # choose a new piece
    next_piece = random.choice(pieces)

    # place the piece at the top of the board
    piece_x = 3
    piece_y = 0
    piece_num = pieces_placed % len(pieces) + 1
    if not can_place(next_piece, piece_x, piece_y):
        break
    place(next_piece, piece_x, piece_y, piece_num)
    pieces_placed += 1

    # draw the board
    draw_board()
    time.sleep(1) # delay for 1 second

    # move piece down and check for complete rows
    while can_place(next_piece, piece_x, piece_y+1):
        piece_y += 1
        place(next_piece, piece_x, piece_y, piece_num)
        draw_board()
        time.sleep(0.1) # delay for 0.1 seconds
        num_rows_removed = remove_complete_rows()
    if num_rows_removed > 0:
        print(f"{num_rows_removed} rows removed.")
        draw_board()
        time.sleep(1) # delay for 1 second
```
And there you have it, a simple console-based Tetris game. Of course, this code can be improved and expanded upon, but this is a good starting point.
